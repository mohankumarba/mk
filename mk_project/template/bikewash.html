<h3> Washing your motorcycle isn’t just about keeping your sweet ride looking great. If you don’t wash your bike regularly and correctly, you’ll risk damaging its looks and its parts. Giving your dirty motorcycle a bath, however, doesn’t require more than some basic supplies like water, a sponge, and detergent. Polish up details like the wheels and any chrome before you finish, and your bike will soon be turning heads again.
